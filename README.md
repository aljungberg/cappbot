Introduction
------------

cappbot gives each pull request for the Cappuccino project a normal issue to track it. This issue can be used to add labels, assign the issue to a specific person and to add it to milestones.

All pull request conversation is moved to the issue, and a link is placed in the pull request directing people to the new issue. The pull request itself is only used to merge and/or comment on individual lines.

Requirements
